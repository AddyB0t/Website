-- Fix Row Level Security Policies for Question Usage Tracking
-- This script fixes the RLS policies that are causing permission errors

-- 1. Drop the restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow full access to question_usage" ON question_usage;

-- 2. Disable RLS temporarily to allow the system to work
ALTER TABLE question_usage DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Alternative: Create more permissive policies that work with the current setup
-- Uncomment these lines if you want to keep RLS enabled:

/*
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE question_usage ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create permissive policies for all operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access to question_usage" ON question_usage FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert access to question_usage" ON question_usage FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow update access to question_usage" ON question_usage FOR UPDATE USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow delete access to question_usage" ON question_usage FOR DELETE USING (true);
*/

-- 4. Grant permissions to make sure the application can access the table
GRANT ALL ON question_usage TO postgres;
GRANT ALL ON question_usage TO public;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE question_usage_id_seq TO postgres;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE question_usage_id_seq TO public;

-- 5. Test that we can now insert data
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Test insert
    INSERT INTO question_usage (user_id, subject_id, class_id, usage_date, questions_asked)
    VALUES ('test-user-123', 'mathematics', '7', CURRENT_DATE, 1)
    ON CONFLICT (user_id, subject_id, class_id, usage_date)
    DO UPDATE SET questions_asked = question_usage.questions_asked + 1;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Successfully inserted/updated test record';
    
    -- Clean up test data
    DELETE FROM question_usage WHERE user_id = 'test-user-123';
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Test completed successfully - RLS issue fixed!';
    
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Error during test: %', SQLERRM;
END $$;

-- 6. Show current table permissions
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    tableowner,
    hasinserts,
    hasupdates,
    hasdeletes,
    hasselects
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'question_usage';

-- 7. Show RLS status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'question_usage';
