# 🚀 PostgreSQL to Supabase Migration Guide

## ✅ **Migration Completed Successfully!**

Your ZapUp website has been successfully migrated from PostgreSQL to Supabase. Here's what has been changed and what you need to do next.

## 🔄 **What Was Changed:**

### 1. **API Routes Updated**
- ✅ `app/api/user-preferences/route.ts` - Now uses Supabase
- ✅ `app/api/profile-picture/route.ts` - Now uses Supabase storage
- ✅ `app/api/test-db/route.ts` - Updated for Supabase testing
- ✅ `app/api/test-db-simple/route.ts` - Updated for Supabase testing

### 2. **Database Service Updated**
- ✅ All imports changed from `@/lib/database` to `@/lib/supabase`
- ✅ Added missing `testConnection()` method to Supabase service
- ✅ Updated profile picture handling to use Supabase storage

### 3. **Dependencies Updated**
- ✅ Removed PostgreSQL dependencies (`pg`, `@types/pg`)
- ✅ Kept Supabase dependencies (`@supabase/supabase-js`)

### 4. **Configuration Updated**
- ✅ Updated `setup-env.sh` for Supabase environment variables
- ✅ Updated test routes to show Supabase connection status

## 🛠️ **Next Steps - Complete Your Migration:**

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Project
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Note down your:
   - Project URL
   - Anon key
   - Service role key

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Clerk Configuration (keep existing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_existing_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_existing_clerk_secret
```

### Step 3: Set Up Database Schema in Supabase
Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy the contents of schema-fixed.sql into Supabase SQL editor
-- This will create all necessary tables and policies
```

### Step 4: Set Up Supabase Storage
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket called `user-uploads`
3. Set it as public
4. Add the following policies:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow users to view their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow public access to profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Public can view profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'user-uploads');
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
Remove old PostgreSQL packages and ensure Supabase is installed:

```bash
npm uninstall pg @types/pg
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Step 6: Test the Migration
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the database connection:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db-simple
   ```

3. Test user preferences (requires authentication):
   - Visit `/profile` page
   - Try updating preferences
   - Upload a profile picture

## 🔧 **Key Differences from PostgreSQL:**

### **Database Queries**
- **Before (PostgreSQL):** Raw SQL queries with `pg` client
- **After (Supabase):** Supabase client with JavaScript methods

### **File Storage**
- **Before:** Base64 encoded files stored in database
- **After:** Files stored in Supabase Storage with public URLs

### **Authentication Integration**
- **Before:** Manual user ID handling
- **After:** Integrated with Supabase Auth (compatible with Clerk)

### **Connection Management**
- **Before:** Connection pooling with PostgreSQL
- **After:** Serverless connections with Supabase

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

### **Data Migration**
If you have existing data in PostgreSQL that you want to keep:
1. Export your PostgreSQL data
2. Import it into Supabase using the SQL editor
3. Update any user IDs to match your Clerk user IDs

### **Environment Variables**
- Remove old PostgreSQL environment variables
- Add Supabase environment variables
- Keep Clerk environment variables unchanged

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**
Supabase uses RLS for data security. The migration includes:
- Users can only access their own data
- Public access for certain shared data
- Storage policies for file access

## 🎯 **Benefits of Supabase Migration:**

1. **Serverless Architecture** - No server management needed
2. **Real-time Features** - Built-in real-time subscriptions
3. **File Storage** - Integrated file storage with CDN
4. **Automatic Backups** - Built-in backup and restore
5. **Scalability** - Automatic scaling based on usage
6. **Dashboard** - User-friendly database management interface

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Database connection test passes
- [ ] User preferences save/load correctly
- [ ] Profile picture upload works
- [ ] User authentication still works
- [ ] All existing features function properly

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Supabase project is properly configured
4. Check Supabase logs in the dashboard

## 🎉 **Migration Complete!**

Your application is now running on Supabase with improved performance, scalability, and features. The migration maintains all existing functionality while adding the benefits of a modern, serverless database platform.
