### Rice Varieties Problem
2. Estu was surprised to know that there were about one lakh varieties of rice in this country. He wondered "One lakh! So far I have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new variety each day, would we even come close to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 years?" 
   
   **To solve this:** Calculate how many days are in 100 years (approximately 36,500 days), then compare this to 1,00,000 varieties.

3. Roxie suggests, "What if we ate 2 varieties of rice every day? Would we then be able to eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?"
   
   **To solve this:** Calculate 2 varieties × 36,500 days and compare to 1,00,000.

4. What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.
