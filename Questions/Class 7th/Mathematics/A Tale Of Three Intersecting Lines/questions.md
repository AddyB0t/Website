# Chapter 7: A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines - Questions

## Introduction to Triangles

### Basic Triangle Concepts
1. Observe the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles are named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices can come in any order. Practice naming triangles using different vertex orders.
   - Given triangle ABC, list all possible ways to name this triangle using its vertices.
   - Explain why ∆ABC, ∆BCA, and ∆CAB all refer to the same triangle.

2. The three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that we call the angles of the triangle. For example, in ∆ABC, these angles are ∠CAB, ∠ABC, ∠BCA, which we simply denote as ∠A, ∠B and ∠C, respectively. Practice identifying and naming angles in given triangles.
   - In triangle PQR, identify and name all three angles using both full notation and simplified notation.
   - Explain the relationship between the vertex and the angle at that vertex.

3. What happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?
   - Draw three points A, B, C on a straight line. Can you form a triangle? Why or why not?
   - What would be the sum of angles in this case? How does this relate to triangle properties?

## 7.1 Equilateral Triangles

### Construction Questions
4. Construct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.

5. How did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can this construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?

6. Constructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But this might require several trials. How do we make this construction more efficient?

7. After constructing AB = 4 cm, we can use a compass to construct arcs. The construction ensures that both AC and BC are of length 4 cm. Can you see why?

## 7.2 Constructing a Triangle When its Sides are Given

### General Triangle Construction
8. How do we construct triangles that are not equilateral?

9. Construct a triangle of sidelength 4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm.

10. How do we construct this triangle more efficiently?

11. The required point C is one of the points of intersection of the two circles. Explain why the point of intersection is the third vertex.

### Construction Practice
12. Construct triangles having the following sidelengths (all the units are in cm):
    - (a) 4, 4, 6
    - (b) 3, 4, 5
    - (c) 1, 5, 5
    - (d) 4, 6, 8
    - (e) 3.5, 3.5, 3.5

13. We have seen that triangles having all three equal sides are called equilateral triangles. Those having two equal sides are called isosceles triangles. Identify the types of triangles in the previous question.

### Figure it Out Problems - Section 7.2
14. Use the points on the circle and/or the centre to form isosceles triangles.
    - Given a circle with center O and points A, B, C on the circumference, identify which triangles formed are isosceles.
    - Explain why triangles formed using the center and any two points on the circle are always isosceles.
    - How many different isosceles triangles can you form using 4 points on a circle and its center?

15. Use the points on the circles and/or their centres to form isosceles and equilateral triangles. The circles are of the same size.
    - Given two circles of equal radius with centers O₁ and O₂, and points marked on both circles, identify possible isosceles and equilateral triangles.
    - What special condition must be satisfied for an equilateral triangle to be formed using points from two circles?
    - Can you form a scalene triangle using these points? Explain your reasoning.

### Triangle Inequality
16. Construct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm. What is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle?

17. Here is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle is possible for these sidelengths.

18. Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.

19. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?

### Triangle Inequality Concept
20. Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle having these as sidelengths? Use the tent, tree, and pole analogy to explain.

21. Imagine a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Which is the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path from the tent to the tree or (ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the straight-line path from the pole to the tree?
    - Let the tent be at point T, tree at point R, and pole at point P. Compare the distances TR vs (TP + PR).
    - Draw a diagram showing all three points and the two possible paths.
    - Explain why the direct path is always shorter than the indirect path.

22. Will the direct path between any two points be shorter than the roundabout path via a third point?

23. Can this understanding be used to tell something about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?

24. For the triangle with sides 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, analyze all three possible paths and determine if the triangle can exist.

25. Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths 3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction.

26. In the rough diagram, is it possible to assign lengths in a different order such that the direct paths are always coming out to be shorter than the roundabout paths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.
    - Consider three lengths a, b, and c. Arrange them so that you're comparing the longest side with the sum of the other two.
    - Explain why we need to check only one condition: longest side < sum of other two sides.
    - Give an example where rearranging the comparison leads to a valid triangle.

### Figure it Out Problems - Triangle Inequality
27. We checked by construction that there are no triangles having sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if you could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.

28. Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of the following sets of lengths?
    - (a) 10 km, 10 km and 25 km
    - (b) 5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm
    - (c) 12 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm

29. For each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less than the sum of the other two. Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.

30. Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without calculations? [Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]

31. Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the existence of a triangle?

### Visualization and Circle Analysis
32. Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm? This satisfies the triangle inequality: 8 < 4 + 5 = 9. Why do we not need to check the other two sides?

33. For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third vertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen without actually carrying out the construction?

34. Let us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the longest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. Can you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure when circles of radius 4 cm and 5 cm are constructed?

35. Note that in the figure, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is BX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?

### Figure it Out Problems - Triangle Existence
36. Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle? Explain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have the same unit of measure.
    - (a) 2, 2, 5
    - (b) 3, 4, 6
    - (c) 2, 4, 8
    - (d) 5, 5, 8
    - (e) 10, 20, 25
    - (f) 10, 20, 35
    - (g) 24, 26, 28

37. Will triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle inequality? How can we be sure?

### Circle Cases Analysis
38. The following different cases can be conceived when constructing circles. Which of these cases will lead to the formation of a triangle?
    - Case 1: Circles touch each other externally at one point
    - Case 2: Circles do not intersect (too far apart)
    - Case 3: Circles intersect each other at two points
    - Case 4: One circle lies completely inside the other
    - Identify which cases allow triangle formation and explain why.

39. For circles to touch each other externally at a point, what should be the relation between the radii and the distance AB?
    - If circles have radii r₁ and r₂, and centers are distance d apart, what is the condition for external tangency?
    - Express this condition as: d = r₁ + r₂
    - What type of triangle (if any) is formed in this case?

40. For circles to not intersect (be too far apart), what should be the relation between the radii and the distance AB?
    - Express the condition for non-intersection: d > r₁ + r₂
    - Explain why no triangle can be formed in this case.
    - Relate this to the triangle inequality principle.

41. For circles to intersect each other at two points, what should be the relation between the radii and the distance AB?
    - Express the condition for intersection: |r₁ - r₂| < d < r₁ + r₂
    - Explain why this case allows triangle formation.
    - Why do we get two possible triangles in this case?

42. Can we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality?

43. How will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy the triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which the circles:
    - (a) touch each other at a point,
    - (b) do not intersect.

44. Frame a complete procedure that can be used to check the existence of a triangle.

### Final Triangle Existence Problems
45. Check if a triangle exists for each of the following set of lengths:
    - (a) 1, 100, 100
    - (b) 3, 6, 9
    - (c) 1, 1, 5
    - (d) 5, 10, 12

46. Does there exist an equilateral triangle with sides 50, 50, 50? In general, does there exist an equilateral triangle of any sidelength? Justify your answer.

47. For each of the following, give at least 5 possible values for the third length so there exists a triangle having these as sidelengths (decimal values could also be chosen):
    - (a) 1, 100
    - (b) 5, 5
    - (c) 3, 7

48. See if you can describe all possible lengths of the third side in each case, so that a triangle exists with those sidelengths. For example, in case (a), all numbers strictly between 99 and 101 would be possible.

## 7.3 Construction of Triangles When Some Sides and Angles are Given

### Two Sides and Included Angle
49. How do we construct a triangle if two sides and the angle included between them are given?

50. Construct a triangle ABC with AB = 5 cm, AC = 4 cm and ∠A= 45°.

### Figure it Out Problems - Two Sides and Included Angle
51. Construct triangles for the following measurements where the angle is included between the sides:
    - (a) 3 cm, 75°, 7 cm
    - (b) 6 cm, 25°, 3 cm
    - (c) 3 cm, 120°, 8 cm

52. Is there a combination of measurements in the case of two sides and the included angle where a triangle is not possible? Justify your answer using what you observe during construction.

### Two Angles and Included Side
53. Construct a triangle ABC where AB = 5 cm, ∠A = 45° and ∠B = 80°.

### Figure it Out Problems - Two Angles and Included Side
54. Construct triangles for the following measurements:
    - (a) ∠A = 75°, AB = 5 cm, ∠B = 75°
    - (b) ∠A = 25°, AB = 3 cm, ∠B = 60°
    - (c) ∠A = 120°, AB = 6 cm, ∠B = 30°
    - For each case, calculate the third angle before construction and verify after construction.

55. Do triangles always exist? Do triangles exist for every combination of two angles and their included side? Explore.

56. Find examples of measurements of two angles with the included side where a triangle is not possible.

57. Once the base is drawn, try to imagine how the other sides should be so that they do not meet.
    - Draw a base AB. From A, draw a ray at angle α. From B, draw a ray at angle β.
    - Under what conditions will these rays be parallel and never meet?
    - What happens when α + β = 180°? Explain using the concept of co-interior angles.

58. If the two angles are greater than or equal to a right angle (90°), then it is clear that a triangle is not possible. Explain why.

59. Now we make one of the base angles an acute angle, say 40°. What are the possible values that the other angle should take so that the lines don't meet?
    - (a) Try to find a possible ∠B for this to happen. [Hint: Consider when the rays become parallel]
    - (b) What could be the smallest value of ∠B for the lines to not meet? [Answer: 140°]
    - (c) Explain why ∠B ≥ 140° prevents triangle formation when ∠A = 40°.

60. Can you tell the actual value of ∠B when the line is parallel? [Hint: Note that AB is the transversal.]
    - When rays from A and B are parallel, what is the relationship between ∠A and ∠B?
    - Use the property of co-interior angles: ∠A + ∠B = 180°
    - If ∠A = 40°, then ∠B = 140° for parallel rays.

61. So, for what values of ∠B, does a triangle not exist? Does the length AB play any part here?

### Figure it Out Problems - Angle Analysis
62. For each of the following angles, find another angle for which a triangle is (a) possible, (b) not possible. Find at least two different angles for each category:
    - (a) 30°
    - (b) 70°
    - (c) 54°
    - (d) 144°

63. Determine which of the following pairs can be the angles of a triangle and which cannot:
    - (a) 35°, 150°
    - (b) 70°, 30°
    - (c) 90°, 85°
    - (d) 50°, 150°

64. Like the triangle inequality, can you form a rule that describes the two angles for which a triangle is possible? Can the sum of the two angles be used for framing this rule?

### Third Angle Analysis
65. Let us take two angles, say 60° and 70°, whose sum is less than 180°. Let the included side be 5 cm. What could the measure of the third angle be? Does this measure change if the base length is changed to some other value, say 7 cm? Construct and find out.

66. In general, once the two angles are fixed, does the third angle depend on the included sidelength? Try with different pairs of angles and lengths.

67. Try experimenting with different triangles to see if there is a relation between any two angles and the third one. To find this relation, what data will you keep track of and how will you organise the data you collect?

68. Consider a triangle ABC with ∠B = 50° and ∠C = 70°. Let us see how we can find ∠A without construction using parallel lines.
    - Draw a line DE parallel to BC through vertex A.
    - Use alternate interior angles to show that ∠DAB = ∠B = 50° and ∠EAC = ∠C = 70°.
    - Since ∠DAB + ∠BAC + ∠EAC = 180° (straight line), find ∠BAC.
    - Therefore, ∠A = 180° - 50° - 70° = 60°.

### Figure it Out Problems - Third Angle
69. Find the third angle of a triangle (using a parallel line) when two of the angles are:
    - (a) 36°, 72°
    - (b) 150°, 15°
    - (c) 90°, 30°
    - (d) 75°, 45°

70. Can you construct a triangle all of whose angles are equal to 70°? If two of the angles are 70° what would the third angle be? If all the angles in a triangle have to be equal, then what must its measure be? Explore and find out.

71. Here is a triangle in which we know ∠B = ∠C and ∠A = 50°. Can you find ∠B and ∠C?

### Angle Sum Property
72. What can we say about the sum of the angles of any triangle?

73. Take some time to reflect upon how we figured out the angle sum property. In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle and the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of drawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex suddenly made the relationship obvious. Explain this method.

74. There is a convenient way of verifying the angle sum property by folding a triangular cut-out of a paper. Do you see how this shows that the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°?

### Exterior Angles
75. The angle formed between the extension of a side of a triangle and the other side is called an exterior angle of the triangle. Find ∠ACD, if ∠A = 50°, and ∠B = 60°.

76. Find the exterior angle for different measures of ∠A and ∠B. Do you see any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles?

77. From angle sum property, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠ACB = 180°. We also have ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle. What does this show?
    - From the first equation: ∠ACB = 180° - ∠A - ∠B
    - From the second equation: ∠ACD = 180° - ∠ACB
    - Substituting: ∠ACD = 180° - (180° - ∠A - ∠B) = ∠A + ∠B
    - This proves the exterior angle theorem: An exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

## 7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles

### Altitude Concepts
78. In the world around us, we talk of the heights of various objects: the height of a person, the height of a tree, the height of a building, etc. What do we mean by the word 'height'?

79. Consider a triangle ABC. What is the height of the vertex A from its opposite side BC, and how can it be measured?

80. Let AD be the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to BC. The length of AD is the height of the vertex A from BC. The line segment AD is said to be one of the 'altitudes' of the triangle. Identify the other altitudes.

81. What would the altitude from A to BC be in an obtuse triangle?
    - In an obtuse triangle where ∠B > 90°, the altitude from A will fall outside the triangle.
    - The foot of the altitude will lie on the extension of side BC, not on BC itself.
    - Draw a diagram showing this case and explain why the altitude extends beyond the triangle.

### Paper Folding Method
82. Cut out a paper triangle. Fix one of the sides as the base. Fold it in such a way that the resulting crease is an altitude from the top vertex to the base. Justify why the crease formed should be perpendicular to the base.

### Construction Method
83. Construct an arbitrary triangle. Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to be the base. Construct the altitude from A to BC.

84. Constructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate. To get a more precise angle of 90°, we use a set square along with a ruler. Can you see how to do this?
    - Place the set square so that one edge aligns with the base BC.
    - The perpendicular edge of the set square shows the direction of the altitude.
    - Use a ruler along this perpendicular edge to draw the altitude from vertex A.
    - Alternatively, use a compass to construct perpendicular bisectors for more precision.

85. Does there exist a triangle in which a side is also an altitude? Visualise such a triangle and draw a rough diagram.
    - Yes, in a right-angled triangle, the two sides forming the right angle serve as altitudes to each other.
    - In triangle ABC with ∠C = 90°, side AC is the altitude to side BC, and side BC is the altitude to side AC.
    - Draw a right triangle and identify these special altitudes.

## 7.5 Types of Triangles

### Triangle Classification
86. The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based on equality of sides. Define equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles.

87. Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is there any relation between these two classifications?

88. What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures?

89. What could an acute-angled triangle be? Can we define it as a triangle with one acute angle? Why not?
    - An acute-angled triangle is one where all three angles are acute (less than 90°).
    - We cannot define it as having just one acute angle because all triangles have at least two acute angles.
    - This is because if two angles were 90° or more, their sum would exceed 180°, violating the angle sum property.
    - Example: A triangle with angles 70°, 60°, and 50° is acute-angled.

### Figure it Out Problems - Triangle Types
90. Construct a triangle ABC with BC = 5 cm, AB = 6 cm, CA = 5 cm. Construct an altitude from A to BC.

91. Construct a triangle TRY with RY = 4 cm, TR = 7 cm, ∠R = 140°. Construct an altitude from T to RY.

92. Construct a right-angled triangle ∆ABC with ∠B = 90°, AC = 5 cm. How many different triangles exist with these measurements? [Hint: Note that the other measurements can take any values. Take AC as the base. What values can ∠A and ∠C take so that the other angle is 90°?]
    - Infinite triangles are possible with these constraints.
    - Since ∠A + ∠C = 90° (as ∠B = 90°), any pair of complementary acute angles works.
    - Examples: ∠A = 30°, ∠C = 60°; or ∠A = 45°, ∠C = 45°; or ∠A = 25°, ∠C = 65°, etc.
    - The position of vertex B can be anywhere on the circle with AC as diameter (Thales' theorem).

93. Through construction, explore if it is possible to construct an equilateral triangle that is (i) right-angled (ii) obtuse-angled.

94. Also construct an isosceles triangle that is (i) right-angled (ii) obtuse-angled.

## Conceptual Understanding Questions

95. What are the essential components of a triangle? How do we denote triangles?

96. What are the advantages of using a compass over just a ruler for triangle construction?

97. Why is the triangle inequality important? What does it tell us about the nature of triangles?

98. Why is the angle sum property of triangles (sum = 180°) significant? How does it help in solving problems?

## Problem-Solving Strategies

101. When constructing a triangle, what systematic approach should you follow?
     - Step 1: Check if the given measurements allow a triangle to exist (triangle inequality, angle sum, etc.)
     - Step 2: Choose the most convenient element to construct first (usually the longest side or known side)
     - Step 3: Use appropriate tools (compass for equal lengths, protractor for angles, set square for perpendiculars)
     - Step 4: Construct remaining elements systematically
     - Step 5: Verify the construction by measuring all elements

102. How can you quickly determine if a triangle with given measurements can exist?
     - For three sides: Check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side
     - For two angles: Check if their sum is less than 180°
     - For side-angle combinations: Ensure angles don't violate the 180° sum rule
     - Use the triangle inequality as the primary test for side lengths

103. What methods can you use to find unknown angles in a triangle?
     - Use the angle sum property: Sum of all angles = 180°
     - Use the exterior angle theorem: Exterior angle = sum of two non-adjacent interior angles
     - Use properties of special triangles (isosceles, equilateral, right-angled)
     - Apply parallel line properties when auxiliary lines are drawn

104. What is the most accurate method to construct an altitude?
     - Method 1: Use a set square aligned with the base to draw a perpendicular from the vertex
     - Method 2: Use compass to construct perpendicular bisector technique
     - Method 3: Use the property that altitude creates two right angles with the base
     - Always verify that the constructed line is indeed perpendicular (90°)

105. How can you identify the type of a triangle from its measurements?
     - By sides: All equal (equilateral), two equal (isosceles), all different (scalene)
     - By angles: All acute (acute), one right angle (right), one obtuse (obtuse)
     - Check Pythagorean theorem for right triangles: a² + b² = c²
     - Use angle measures to classify: acute (<90°), right (=90°), obtuse (>90°)

## Real-World Applications

## Challenge Problems

111. There is a spider in a corner of a box. It wants to reach the farthest opposite corner. Since it cannot fly, it can reach the opposite point only by walking on the surfaces of the box. What is the shortest path it can take?
     - Consider a rectangular box with dimensions length (l), width (w), and height (h).
     - The spider needs to "unfold" the box surfaces to find the straight-line distance.
     - There are three possible unfolding patterns, each giving a different path length.
     - Calculate each path and compare to find the minimum distance.

112. Take a cardboard box and mark the path that you think is the shortest from one corner to its opposite corner. Compare the length of this path with that of the paths made by your friends.
     - Method 1: Unfold adjacent faces and draw straight line
     - Method 2: Use different face combinations for unfolding
     - Method 3: Apply Pythagorean theorem to calculate exact distances
     - Verify experimentally by measuring string lengths along different paths
     - Compare theoretical calculations with experimental measurements

## Extended Challenge Problems

113. Given that one angle of a triangle is twice another angle, and the third angle is 30° more than the smallest angle, find all three angles.
     - Let the smallest angle be x°
     - Set up equations: x + 2x + (x + 30) = 180
     - Solve: 4x + 30 = 180, so x = 37.5°
     - The three angles are 37.5°, 75°, and 67.5°

114. Create a set of measurements that seems like it should form a triangle but actually violates multiple triangle properties. Explain why it's impossible.
     - Example: Sides 5 cm, 12 cm, 20 cm with angles 30°, 60°, 90°
     - Check triangle inequality: 5 + 12 = 17 < 20 (violates inequality)
     - Check angle sum: 30° + 60° + 90° = 180° (seems correct)
     - Explain why both conditions must be satisfied independently

115. Among all triangles with a fixed perimeter, which triangle has the maximum area?
     - Use the concept that for a fixed perimeter, the equilateral triangle has maximum area
     - This can be proven using calculus or the isoperimetric inequality
     - Relate this to the efficiency of triangular structures in nature and engineering
