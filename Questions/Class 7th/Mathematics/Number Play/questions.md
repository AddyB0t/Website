# Chapter 6: Number Play - Questions

## 6.1 Numbers Tell us Things

### Understanding Number Sequences
1. The rule is — each child calls out the number of children in front of them who are taller than them. Check if the number each child says matches this rule in both the arrangements.

2. Write down the number each child should say based on this rule for the arrangement shown below.

### Figure it Out Problems - Section 6.1
3. Create height arrangements using drawings or cutouts such that when each person calls out the number of people taller than them who are standing in front, the sequence reads:
   - (a) 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5 [Note: Draw 7 people of different heights arranged so this sequence works]
   - (b) 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 [Note: All people should be the same height]
   - (c) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 [Note: Arrange from tallest to shortest]
   - (d) 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 [Note: Alternating tall-short pattern]
   - (e) 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 [Note: One tallest person, rest of equal shorter height]
   - (f) 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3 [Note: First 3 people same height, last 4 people same shorter height]

4. For each of the statements given below, think and identify if it is Always True, Only Sometimes True, or Never True. Share your reasoning.
   - (a) If a person says '0', then they are the tallest in the group.
   - (b) If a person is the tallest, then their number is '0'.
   - (c) The first person's number is '0'.
   - (d) If a person is not first or last in line (i.e., if they are standing somewhere in between), then they cannot say '0'.
   - (e) The person who calls out the largest number is the shortest.
   - (f) What is the largest number possible in a group of 8 people?

## 6.2 Picking Parity

### Basic Parity Understanding
5. Kishor has some number cards and is working on a puzzle: There are 5 boxes, and each box should contain exactly 1 number card. The numbers in the boxes should sum to 30. Can you help him find a way to do it?

6. Can you figure out which 5 cards add to 30? Is it possible?

7. There are many ways of choosing 5 cards from this collection. Is there a way to find a solution without checking all possibilities?

### Even and Odd Number Properties
8. Add a few even numbers together. What kind of number do you get? Does it matter how many numbers are added?

9. Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?

10. Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection of pairs?

11. What about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged in pairs?

12. Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.

### Real-World Applications
13. Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not?

14. As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? Try some other consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.

15. What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd number?

### Figure it Out Problems - Section 6.2
16. Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd and even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:
    - (a) Sum of 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers (e.g., even + even + odd + odd)
    - (b) Sum of 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers
    - (c) Sum of 5 even numbers
    - (d) Sum of 8 odd numbers

17. Lakpa has an odd number of ₹1 coins, an odd number of ₹5 coins and an even number of ₹10 coins in his piggy bank. He calculated the total and got ₹205. Did he make a mistake? If he did, explain why. If he didn't, how many coins of each type could he have?

18. We know that:
    - (a) even + even = even
    - (b) odd + odd = even
    - (c) even + odd = odd
    
    Similarly, find out the parity for the scenarios below:
    - (d) even – even = ____
    - (e) odd – odd = ____
    - (f) even – odd = ____
    - (g) odd – even = ____

### Small Squares in Grids
19. In a 3 × 3 grid, there are 9 small squares, which is an odd number. Meanwhile, in a 3 × 4 grid, there are 12 small squares, which is an even number. Given the dimensions of a grid, can you tell the parity of the number of small squares without calculating the product?

20. Find the parity of the number of small squares in these grids:
    - (a) 27 × 13
    - (b) 42 × 78
    - (c) 135 × 654

### Parity of Expressions
21. Consider the algebraic expression: 3n + 4. For different values of n, the expression has different parity. Come up with an expression that always has even parity.

22. Some examples are: 100p and 48w – 2. Try to find more.

23. Come up with expressions that always have odd parity.

24. Come up with other expressions, like 3n + 4, which could have either odd or even parity.

25. The expression 6k + 2 evaluates to 8, 14, 20,... (for k = 1, 2, 3,...) — many even numbers are missing. Are there expressions using which we can list all the even numbers? Hint: All even numbers have a factor 2.

26. Are there expressions using which we can list all odd numbers?

    - (b) Then subtract 1 from the even number.

## 6.3 Some Explorations in Grids

### Grid Filling Rules
32. Observe this 3 × 3 grid. It is filled following a simple rule — use numbers from 1 – 9 without repeating any of them. There are circled numbers outside the grid. Are you able to see what the circled numbers represent?

33. Fill the grids below based on the rule mentioned above.

34. Make a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your peers.

35. Try solving the problem below. You might have realised that it is not possible to find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?

36. The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. Therefore, this is impossible! Explain this reasoning.

### Magic Squares
37. Kishor noticed that the sum of all the numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, Vidya observed that the sum of the circled numbers for all three rows, or for all three columns, was always 45. Check if this is true in the previous grids you have solved.

38. Why should the row sums and column sums always add to 45?

39. A square grid of numbers is called a magic square if each row, each column and each diagonal, add up to the same number. This number is called the magic sum.

40. Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways.

### Magic Square Construction
41. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?

42. In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, what must the magic sum be?

43. What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a magic square?

44. Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must come in one of the other squares. Analyze this possibility.

45. Can the central number be 1? If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other squares. Analyze this possibility.

46. Using such reasoning, find out which other numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre.

47. The number occurring at the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, must be 5. Explain why.

48. Can 1 occur in a corner position? If yes, then there should exist three ways of adding 1 with two other numbers to give 15.

49. Similarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?

50. Can you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?

51. Now, we have one full row or column of the magic square! Try completing it! [Hint: First fill the row or columns containing 1 and 9]

### Figure it Out Problems - Section 6.3
52. How many different magic squares can be made using the numbers 1 – 9?

53. Create a magic square using the numbers 2 – 10. What strategy would you use for this? Compare it with the magic squares made using 1 – 9.

54. Take a magic square, and
    - (a) increase each number by 1
    - (b) double each number
    
    In each case, is the resulting grid also a magic square? How do the magic sums change in each case?

55. What other operations can be performed on a magic square to yield another magic square?

56. Discuss ways of creating a magic square using any set of 9 consecutive numbers (like 2 – 10, 3 – 11, 9 – 17, etc.).

### Generalising a 3 × 3 Magic Square
57. Choose any magic square that you have made so far using consecutive numbers. If m is the letter-number of the number in the centre, express how other numbers are related to m, how much more or less than m.

### Figure it Out Problems - Generalized Magic Squares
58. Using this generalised form, find a magic square if the centre number is 25.

59. What is the expression obtained by adding the 3 terms of any row, column or diagonal?

60. Write the result obtained by—
    - (a) adding 1 to every term in the generalised form.
    - (b) doubling every term in the generalised form

61. Create a magic square whose magic sum is 60.

62. Is it possible to get a magic square by filling nine non-consecutive numbers?

### Historical Magic Squares
63. The first ever recorded 4 × 4 magic square is found in a 10th century inscription at the Pārśhvanath Jain temple in Khajuraho, India, and is known as the Chautīsā Yantra. Chautīs means 34. Why do you think they called it the Chautīsā Yantra?

64. Every row, column and diagonal in this magic square adds up to 34. Can you find other patterns of four numbers in the square that add up to 34?

## 6.4 Nature's Favourite Sequence: The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers!

### Discovery and Context
65. How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables (1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one fill 8 beats with short and long syllables, where a short syllable takes one beat of time and a long syllable takes two beats of time.

66. Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1's and 2's?

67. Here are some possibilities for 8 beats. Can you find others?

68. Try writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways in your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 different ways!)

69. Can you figure out the answer without listing down all the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8?

70. Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long syllables having 5 beats. Write a '1+' in front of all rhythms having 4 beats, and then a '2+' in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives us all the rhythms having 5 beats. Explain why this method works.

71. How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, i.e., 8 + 5 = 13.

72. Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 6 as the sum of 1's and 2's in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?

### Sequence Properties
73. Write the next number in the sequence, after 55.

74. We have seen that the next number in the sequence is given by adding the two previous numbers. Check that this holds true for the numbers given above.

75. Write the next 3 numbers in the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ____, ____, ____, …

76. If you have to write one more number in the sequence above, can you tell whether it will be an odd number or an even number (without adding the two previous numbers)?

77. What is the parity of each number in the sequence? Do you notice any pattern in the sequence of parities?

### Nature Connections

    ```
    T
    T
    + T
    UT
    ```
    Here, we have a one-digit number that, when added to itself twice, gives a 2-digit sum. What could U and T be? Can T be 2? Can it be 3?

80. Here K2 means that the number is a 2-digit number having the digit '2' in the units place and 'K' in the tens place. K2 is added to itself to give a 3-digit sum HMM. What digit should the letter M correspond to?

81. Find out what each letter stands for:
    ```
    YY        B5        KP        C1
    + Z       + 3D      + KP      + C
    ZOO       ED5       PRR       1FF
    ```

82. Share how you thought about each question with your classmates; you may find some new approaches.
