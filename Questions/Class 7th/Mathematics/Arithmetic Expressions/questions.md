12. Four friends go to a restaurant and their bill comes to ₹92. They decide to give a tip of ₹8. If the total number of friends goes up to 7 and the tip remains the same, how much will they have to pay? Write an expression for this situation and identify its terms.

### Expression Writing from Scenarios
13. Ruby's teacher asks students to write expressions for the number of students in their class. The class has 33 students. For each of the cases below, write the expression and identify its terms:
    - If the teacher had called out '4', Ruby would write 4 × 8 + 1 (since 4 × 8 + 1 = 33)
    - If the teacher had called out '7', Ruby would write 7 × 4 + 5 (since 7 × 4 + 5 = 33)

### Tinker the Terms I
22. Fill the blanks, doing as little computation as possible:

| Expression | Value | Expression | Value | Expression | Value |
|------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|-------|
| 53 + (–16) = | 37 | 53 + (–16) = | 37 | –87 + (–16) = | –103 |
| 54 + (–16) = | 38 | 53 + (–15) = | 38 | 52 + (–16) = | 36 |
| 54 is one more than 53, so the value will be 1 more than 37 | | Is –15 one more or one less than –16? –15 is one more than –16 | | 52 is one less than 53, so the value will be 1 less than 37 | |
| 55 + (–16) = | ____ | 53 + (–17) = | 36 | 51 + (–16) = | ____ |
| 56 + (–16) = | ____ | Is –17 one more or one less than –16? –17 is one less than –16 | | 50 + (–16) = | ____ |
| 57 + (–16) = | ____ | 53 + (–18) = | ____ | –88 + (–15) = | –103 |
| | | 53 + (–19) = | ____ | –86 + (–18) = | –104 |

    (b) 87 + 46 – 109, 87 – 46 + 109, 87 – (46 + 109), (87 – 46) + 109

27. Add brackets at appropriate places in the expressions such that they lead to the values indicated:
    (a) 34 – 9 + 12 = 13
    (b) 56 – 14 – 8 = 34
    (c) –22 – 12 + 10 + 22 = –22
