# Chapter 5: Parallel and Intersecting Lines - Questions

## 5.1 Across the Line

### Exploration Questions
1. Take a piece of square paper and fold it in different ways. Now, on the creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale. You will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and observe their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do not meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were extended beyond the paper?

2. When a pair of lines meet each other at a point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other. How many angles do they form?

3. Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point?

### Activity 1: Measuring Intersecting Lines
4. Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of intersection.

5. What patterns do you observe among these angles?

6. In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them?

### Theoretical Questions
7. When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d are equal! Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?

8. Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a?

9. What are linear pairs? What is their sum?

10. What are vertically opposite angles? What is their relationship?

### Figure it Out Problems
11. List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you observe in Fig. 5.3:
    - Linear Pairs: ∠a and ∠b, …
    - Pairs of Vertically Opposite Angles: ∠b and ∠d, …

### Measurement and Geometry Discussion
12. You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this?

## 5.2 Perpendicular Lines

13. Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are equal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?

## 5.3 Between Lines

### Line Segment Analysis
15. Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of each angle.

16.

23. 
    - Make one more horizontal fold in the folded sheet. How many parallel lines do you see now?
    - What will happen if you do it once more? How many parallel lines will you get? Is there a pattern? Check if the pattern extends further, if you make another horizontal fold.

    - How many distinct angles have formed now?

38. 
    - Step 3: Mark a point Y on line t.
    - Step 4: Draw a line m through point Y that forms a 60° angle to line t.

39. What can you conclude about the relationship between corresponding angles and parallel lines?

### Activity 4: Verifying Corresponding Angles
40. Fig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines l and m. Line t is the transversal across these two lines. ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles. Take a tracing paper and trace ∠a on it. Now place this tracing paper over ∠b and see if the angles align exactly. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a protractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?

### Activity 5: Non-Parallel Lines

### Paper Folding Method
47. For a line l (given as a crease), how do we make a line parallel to l such that it passes through point A?

48. We know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l. Now, try to fold a perpendicular to l such that it passes through point A. Let us call this new crease t. Now, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us call this line m. Why are lines l and m parallel to each other?

## 5.8 Alternate Angles

49. In Fig. 5.25, ∠d is called the alternate angle of ∠f, and ∠c is the alternate angle of ∠e. How do you find the alternate angle of a given angle?

### Activity 6: Calculating Alternate Angles
50. In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d?

51. We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are vertically opposite angles. What is the measure of ∠b? Why?

52. Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any measurements, justify that alternate angles are always equal.
